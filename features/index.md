## Getting Started

Cutestrap Two has evolved in quite a few ways and packs a mighty punch for such
a small project. It's best to imagine if it was an animal, it would be a Mantis
Shrimp. I'll leave you to come up with metaphors for other CSS Frameworks.

To have a less overwhelming starting point, think about what problems you're
trying to solve and jump in there. What do you need to do?

### [Customize a Theme](/features/themes)

The first thing you'll probably want to do is get rid of the default Cutepink
color. And maybe the grays are also a little bland for your taste. I totally
get it and that's exactly why it's so easy to theme Cutestrap.

### [Build Forms](/features/forms)

Forms are a hassle. They are always just wrong enough that it's annoying, but
just right enough that you're not going to fix it. Cutestrap takes care of
this, so you can focus on building your actual product.

### [Alter Typography](/features/typography)

A baseline grid provides a consistent Vertical Rhythm, or consistent vertical
spacing between elements. All spacing in Cutestrap subscribes to the rhythm
allowing for easily altering the size of the entire page contents.


### [Create a Styleguide](/features/styleguide)

KSS builds a styleguide using comments from CSS source code. If you fork
Cutestrap, you can easily add your own components and generate living
documentation of your styles.

### [Choose Your Own Bundle](/features/bundle)

Instead of using the full version of Cutestrap, you can choose each piece a la
carte to get the smallest footprint for your project.


### [Learn the Popsicle Convention](/features/popsicle)

There are a lot of great options and patterns available for naming your
CSS Selectors, but Popsicle gives you concise, safe modifiers with only a
small increase in specificity.

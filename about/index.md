Hi there. I'm Tyler and I've been working as a software engineer doing web
development, specifically front-end, for over ten years. I've always been in
favor of sharing information and knowledge freely via open-source code.

When I first published Cutestrap back in May of 2016, it was mostly something
I made for myself. I've always published the tools (or toys) I've built, but
Cutestrap took off a little bit. I found out about Hacker News because someone
posted Cutestrap there and then it got almost 1k stars on GitHub in one day.

I was somewhat mortified, honestly. It was like inviting a couple close friends
over for a BBQ, but then everyone in town crashes the party and you totally
didn't clean the house.

### Anyways...

I felt like I could do better than the, one step above
normalize and two steps below Bootstrap, project that I gave you. The reason I simultaneously
put so much and so little effort into that landing page was because of the pun.

Long story short, I knew I could do better and that _you_ deserve better from me.
To anyone that opened up PRs, issues, sent me emails, I'm sorry. I appreciate you,
but I was honestly super overwhelmed and just kinda shut down and focused on
my life and my day job.

But I never forgot about you. I've been thinking about you for years and what I
could make that was practical, yet bleeding edge. Innovative, yet familiar.
Complex, but approachable.

I don't think Cutestrap will be for everyone, but if any of this project resonates
with you and you get some value out of it: thank you. I've poured countless hours
into this project and by the time you read this and I'm just glad you're here.

### What's next?

At this point, I'm not sure, but I do know that want the people using Cutestrap
to tell me what they want. What's missing? What's confusing? What keeps you up
at night?

Reach out and let's make the future together.
